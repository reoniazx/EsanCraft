//! The JSON control channel's UI side. The app's TCP server turns each request line into a
//! [`ControlRequest`]; they are handled on the UI thread here, so every command an agent sends
//! goes through exactly the same code as a click.
//!
//! Methods:
//! - `engine.execute {command, params}` (alias `command`): run any command programmatically (no dialogs)
//! - `engine.commands {filter?}`, `engine.parity`, `session.inspect {detail?}`, `ui.inspect`
//! - `ui.menu.list`, `ui.menu.invoke {path: "Track > New..." | id}` (menu-style: may open dialogs)
//! - `ui.click {x,y,button?,count?,mods?}`, `ui.move {x,y}`, `ui.drag {x,y,to_x,to_y,steps?}`
//! - `ui.scroll {x,y,dx?,dy?,unit?,steps?,mods?}` (trackpad swipe or wheel), `ui.zoom {x,y,factor,steps?}` (pinch)
//! - `ui.key {key, cmd?, shift?, alt?, ctrl?}`, `ui.text {text}`
//! - `ui.scroll {x,y,dx?,dy?,phase?,cmd?,shift?}`, `ui.zoom {x,y,factor}` (trackpad input)
//! - `ui.screenshot {path?}` (PNG; base64 when no path), `ui.set {...UiState fields}`
//! - `app.quit`
//!
//! Scripted-input methods reply only after a UI pass applied their events, and later requests wait
//! behind that gesture. The connection's one-request-at-a-time reply order therefore also orders an
//! inspect, command or screenshot after the gesture it follows.
